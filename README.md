## ðŸ“œ Overview

GC Simulator is an educational project created to explore advanced garbage collection concepts, memory management, and event listener management in JavaScript and TypeScript. Using simulated data and a structured approach to resource management, this project aims to illustrate how garbage collection and memory allocation can be optimized in real-world applications.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Simulated Heap Allocation**: Objects are dynamically allocated in memory, simulating a real heap structure.
- **Event Listener Management**: Centralized handling of API event listeners, enabling efficient cleanup and preventing memory leaks.
- **Automatic Garbage Collection Simulation**: Demonstrates *Mark-and-Sweep* GC principles, where unreferenced memory is marked and cleared.
- **API Integration**: Retrieves simulated data from a free API for demonstration, allowing you to observe GC concepts in action.
- **TypeScript Support**: Provides strong typing and a better developer experience for building robust memory management logic.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives

This project is designed to help you understand:

1. How garbage collection works in JavaScript.
2. Advanced concepts like *Mark-and-Sweep* GC.
3. Proper event listener management to prevent memory leaks.
4. Effective API integration and cleanup strategies for real-world applications.
